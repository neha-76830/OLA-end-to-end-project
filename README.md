Welcome to my end-to-end *Data Analytics Project* based on large-scale OLA cab booking data. This project demonstrates the complete data analysis workflow — from raw data cleaning in *Excel, data transformation using **SQL, to professional dashboard creation in **Power BI* — all built on a dataset of over *100,000 rows* representing bookings from January 2024.

### Tools & Skills Used:
- *Excel*: Used for initial data preprocessing tasks such as removing blank rows, handling duplicates, and ensuring clean formatting before importing into SQL.
- *SQL (PostgreSQL)*: Performed data cleaning, aggregation, KPI calculation, joining tables, and preparing data models for analysis.
- *Power BI*: Created interactive dashboards using DAX, slicers, and visual storytelling to extract insights from complex datasets.

### Dashboard Highlights:
- *Total Bookings Overview*: Displays total rides, success rate, and different types of cancellations.
- *Revenue Insights*: Shows earnings based on various payment methods (UPI, Wallet, EMI, Cash, etc.) and highlights top 5 revenue-generating customers.
- *Ride Trends*: Visualizes daily ride volume and distance traveled through time-series charts.
- *Vehicle Type Analysis*: Compares bookings across cab types — Mini, Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Auto, Bike, and E-Bike.
- *Cancellation Dashboard*: Breaks down cancellations by driver vs customer and visualizes reasons using pie charts.
- *Rating Analysis*: Tracks average driver and customer ratings by vehicle type to monitor service quality.

### Why This Project Stands Out:
This project reflects a real-world business scenario and shows my ability to manage large datasets across multiple tools. From cleaning messy data in Excel, writing efficient SQL queries for meaningful insights, to building a user-friendly and dynamic dashboard in Power BI — this project highlights my complete analytics skillset and is ideal for Data Analyst roles or internships.

> *Project Goal*: To transform raw cab booking data into actionable business insights that can help improve service quality, customer satisfaction, and operational performance at OLA.
